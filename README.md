# Underbar Part 2

This repo is a supplement to [part 1](https://github.com/tim-hr/underbar-pt1).

This repo contains the following functions:

* `extend()`
* `defaults()`
* `once()`
* `delay()`
* `shuffle()`

You will be expected to be able to reproduce these Underbar functions at will, as well.

The `underbar-pt2.js` file at the top level is ready for you to fill in implementations.

Study the tests and try to make them pass.

If you want to peek at solutions to unblock yourself, they are in the `solutions` directory.
